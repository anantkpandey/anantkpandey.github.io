        <p>I apply the engineering design process to design, develop, test, maintain, and evaluate computer software. I use my knowledge of computer science         and engineering principles to create software that meets the needs of users. I work in a wide variety of industries, including technology, finance,          healthcare, and education. Some of the things that I do include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Analyzing user needs:</b> I work with users to understand their needs and requirements. I then use this information to design software                 that meets those needs.</li>
            <li><b>Designing software:</b> I design the architecture of software systems and the algorithms that I use. I also design the user interface and                 user experience of software applications.</li>
            <li><b>Developing software:</b> I write code to implement the designs that I have created. I also test the code to make sure that it works as                 intended.</li>
            <li><b>Maintaining software:</b> I fix bugs in software and make changes to meet new requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have a strong understanding of computer science principles, including programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. I also work                 effectively in a team and communicate my ideas clearly.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of what I do on a daily basis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet with product managers and other stakeholders to discuss new features or changes to existing features.</li>
            <li>Design and develop software algorithms and data structures.</li>
            <li>Write code in a programming language such as Python, Java, or C++.</li>
            <li>Test code to ensure that it works as intended.</li>
            <li>Debug code to fix any bugs that are found.</li>
            <li>Deploy code to production servers so that it can be used by users.</li>
            <li>Monitor software performance and make changes as needed.</li>
        </ul>
